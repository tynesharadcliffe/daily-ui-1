# Daily UI Challenge Number 1 - Create a sign up form

Firstly, I created a mock-up in Adobe XD to get a feel of the design I was going to use for this. I got my inspiration from a piece of modern interior that I found on Google.
Once the mock-up was complete to where I felt like it looked OK, I then started to code out the form using VS Code. 
Tweaking it here and there (and a fight with Javascript validation- which I lost), this is the final piece. 

Feel free to have a look, give some constructive feedback and also something you like about this.

I appreciate you (even if you've only come across to have a look) :)
